**Experiment guideline** please see Appendix A in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06830

.py files contain functions/classes to run .ipynb

We show example usage in each .ipynb file step by step, please follow the instructure to use our codes.

With only OrderFusion_Preprocessing.ipynb and OrderFusion_Modeling.ipynb, it is sufficient to run real-time prediction.
